# :moneybag::fire::fire::computer: Complete Node.js Developer 2.0 Course :computer::fire::fire::moneybag:
Course Description
Are you looking to create real-world Node applications? Maybe you want to switch careers or launch a side-project to generate some extra income. Either way, you're in the right place.:moneybag::moneybag::moneybag: :money_with_wings::money_with_wings:

I've designed this course around a single goal: Turning you into a professional Node developer capable of developing, testing, and deploying real-world production applications. :mortar_board: :mortar_board: :octocat:

There's no better time to dive in. According to the 2016 Stack Overflow Survey, Node is in the top ten for back-end popularity and back-end salary, with an average salary of $85k. This means more jobs and more opportunities for you!

"Andrew Mead is perhaps the best instructor in Udemy's portfolio. His explanations are clear, his pace is great, and he is super responsive to questions. I highly recommend his courses." Bert McLees

This is a course for the doer. :computer: :computer: :bulb: :bulb:
